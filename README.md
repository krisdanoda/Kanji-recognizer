Proposal 

We would like to make a Kanji recognition program. Kanji are Japanese characters with chinese origin. Because there are 50k characters, it is impossible for the average person to learn all characters and the Japanese government has attempted to minimize the list of Kanji's used. 
We will make a machine learning model using an open-source python library. Since the data set is 140,000 samples large (https://datasets.activeloop.ai/docs/ml/datasets/kuzushiji-kanji-kkanji-dataset/#kuzushiji-kanji-kkanji-dataset) we will web scrape Japanese websites to find the most used kanji characters to reduce the data set. The idea is to feed the program an image of a kanji character, where the program will try to recognize the character and display it on the screen.
